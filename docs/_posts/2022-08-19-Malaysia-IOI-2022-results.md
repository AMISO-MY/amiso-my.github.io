Our Malaysian team won 4 Bronzes at the 2022 International Olympiad in Informatics (IOI) at Yogyakarta, Indonesia.

The IOI is one of 13 international science olympiads. The primary goal of the IOI is to stimulate interest in informatics (computing science) and information technology. Another important goal is to bring together exceptionally talented pupils from various countries and to have them share scientific and cultural experiences.

349 participants from 88 countries took part in IOI 2022. Detailed results can be found at the [IOI 2022 results page](https://stats.ioinformatics.org/results/2022).

Malaysian students interested in the informatics Olympiad can keep an eye out for the [Malaysian Computing Challenge (MCC)](/ioi/), which is the national selection test in Malaysia for IOI.

Congratulations to the team, and we wish them all the best in their future journeys!
