Our Malaysian team won an Honourable Mention at the 2022 International Linguistics Olympiad (IOL) at Castletown, Isle of Man.

{% include gallery caption="The Malaysia IOL 2022 team" %}

The IOL is one of 13 International Science Olympiads for secondary school students, and has been held annually since 2003. Each year, teams of young linguists from around the world gather and test their minds against the worldâ€™s toughest puzzles in language and linguistics.

184 participants from 33 countries took part in IOL 2022. Detailed results can be found at the [IOL 2022 results page](https://ioling.org/results/2022).

Malaysian students interested in the linguistics Olympiad can keep an eye out for the [Malaysian Computational Linguistics Olympiad (MyCLO)](/iol/), which is the national selection test in Malaysia for IOL.

Congratulations to the team, and we wish them all the best in their future journeys!
