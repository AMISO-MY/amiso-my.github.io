[Register now!](https://registration.ioimalaysia.org/)

Malaysian Computing Challenge (MCC) is the Malaysian national selection test for the International Olympiad in Informatics (IOI). These details are summarised from the [official website](https://ioimalaysia.org/competition/mcc/2022/). Please refer to the official website for the most up-to-date information.

## Registration:

Teachers and independent participants can register at the [official registration site](https://registration.ioimalaysia.org/).

Registration deadline: 15 October 2022


## Competition date:

29th October 2022 (Saturday)

## Fee per student:

RM 10


## Format:
This year, MCC will be held on SimpleCMS (our in-house contest system!). Participants will be required to solve 4-6 problems within a two-day window. Participants may work on the contest anywhere, including at home. The problem statements will be available in both English and Bahasa Malaysia.

- Each task consists of an input that is unique to each participant.
- For each task, participants will be required to submit an output (by typing/pasting the output into a text box) that satisfies the statement and input.
- Participants will know whether their submission is correct immediately after it is made.
- The more difficult tasks will likely require programming knowledge.
- Note: Participants will not need to upload any files during the contest (including any code they may have written). Therefore, participants may use any programming language (or even solve by hand for small inputs).
Python is recommended for beginners, and C++ is recommended as it is the only language supported in the later rounds.
- Participants are encouraged to save any code they have written to be submitted for the exit interview.

## What's after MCC?
MCC is the preliminary selection process of a year-long program to identify and train the top computing talents in Malaysian schools. Top scorers in MCC will be:

- Invited to a training camp introducing algorithms and algorithmic thinking, tentatively to be held in December 2022 (may be in-person or virtual).
- Invited to the Malaysian Computing Olympiad (MCO), a programming competition to be held tentatively in April 2023.

The top scorers in MCO will be called for a series of intensive training camps conducted by experienced Olympiad participants. Students who qualify at this level will participate in the Asia-Pacific Informatics Olympiad (APIO), an annual online contest among countries in the Pacific Rim region. After the training camps and APIO, four students will be selected to represent Malaysia in the International Olympiad in Informatics (IOI) 2023 which will take place in Hungary in August 2023.
