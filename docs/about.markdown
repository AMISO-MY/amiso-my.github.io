# Who are we?
We are the Malaysians who have represented the country in the International Science Olympiads.

# What are the International Science Olympiads?

> The International Science Olympiads are a group of worldwide annual competitions in various areas of the formal sciences, natural sciences, and social sciences. The competitions are designed for the 4-6 best high school students from each participating country selected through internal National Science Olympiads. (Wikipedia)

To get into the national team for any ISO, you must take part in the National Selection Tests (NST). In Malaysia, each ISO have their own NST and local organiser. You can learn more at our Olympiads page.

# Why AMISO?
We want to spread awareness about national selection tests in the International Science Olympiads to every Malaysian student regardless of educational background and circumstances. In the long term, we hope that Malaysia becomes a top-performing country in the International Science Olympiads, and in the process, the young Malaysian generation will be inspired in the field of the sciences.
