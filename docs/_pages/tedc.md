# Introduction
The Econference Discovery Challenge (TEDC) is the first ever student-led, nation-wide competitive social science quiz challenge hosted by AMISO, in collaboration with Asia Pacific University of Technology & Innovation!

Our main purpose is to promote interests in competitive social science subjects (especially Olympiad competitions) amongst **high school and pre-university students** in Malaysia, while also equipping participants with the knowledge to prepare themselves for the selection tests of International Olympiads.

TEDC 2023 involves rewarding outstanding challengers and creating a supportive and collaborative atmosphere for students to learn and develop together.

The Econference Discovery Challenge consists of 2 rounds: the **Preliminary Round**, and the **Final Game Show Round**. Participants will have to qualify in the preliminary round in order to proceed.
