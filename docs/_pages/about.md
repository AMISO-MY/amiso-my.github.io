# Who are we?

We are the Malaysians who have represented the country in the International Science Olympiads. AMISO is a national society based in KL with the registration number PPM-008-14-29062022.

# What are the International Science Olympiads?

> The International Science Olympiads (ISO) are a group of worldwide annual competitions in various areas of the formal sciences, natural sciences, and social sciences. The competitions are designed for the 4-6 best high school students from each participating country selected through internal National Science Olympiads. (Wikipedia)

To get into the national team for any ISO, you must take part in the national selection tests. In Malaysia, each ISO have their own selection test and local organiser. You can learn more about these National Selection Tests (NST) [here](/olympiads/).

# Why AMISO?

## Background of AMISO

The Association of Malaysian Alumni in the International Science Olympiads, termed AMISO, is a not-for-profit, student-run organisation that gathers Malaysian alumni of the International Science Olympiads (such as IMO, IChO, IPhO) and Malaysian youth aspiring towards representing the nation in the sciences.

## Vision and Mission

Responding to the under-awareness of the Science Olympiads in the Malaysian academic climate, AMISO aims to create exposure of the diversity of opportunities that the Science Olympiads present to the Malaysian youth at every level, which serve as the inspiration for our initiatives. We envision driving social change through forging an academic climate that renders Malaysia a top-performing country in the Olympiads.
