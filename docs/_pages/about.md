# Who are we?

We are the Malaysians who have represented the country in the International Science Olympiads. AMISO is a national society based in KL with the registration number PPM-008-14-29062022.

# What are the International Science Olympiads?

> The International Science Olympiads (ISO) are a group of worldwide annual competitions in various areas of the formal sciences, natural sciences, and social sciences. The competitions are designed for the 4-6 best high school students from each participating country selected through internal National Science Olympiads. (Wikipedia)

To get into the national team for any ISO, you must take part in the national selection tests. In Malaysia, each ISO have their own selection test and local organiser. You can learn more about these NST [here](/olympiads/).

# Why AMISO?

We want to let every Malaysian student know about the opportunities in the International Science Olympiads and the Malaysian national selection tests. In the long term, we aim to help Malaysia become a top-performing country in the Olympiads, and by doing so, we hope to inspire the young Malaysian generation in the sciences.
