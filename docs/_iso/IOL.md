Malaysian Computational Linguistics Olympiad

[Official MyCLO website](https://myclo.my/)

## Selection Process

MyCLO is the competition used in Malaysia to shortlist contestants. Winners will be invited to a training camp and APLO, then evaluated further to choose the four representatives to the IOL.

Introduction

The first IOL was held on 2003 in Bulgaria. The Olympiad tests on computational linguistics, which can usually be solved by recognizing patterns. Linguistics knowledge is not necessary but is very helpful in solving the problems.

There are usually one to two math-related problems each year, for example by mapping arabic numbers to numbers in their language. Proficiency in Mathematics (such as knowing how numbers can change base) will be useful in solving these types of problems.
