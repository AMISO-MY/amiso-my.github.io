# Selection Process

The K3M is a national level test offered to most secondary schools. Every year, top scorers of the selection test will be invited to join the IChO training camp.<br><br>Starting from 2021, Universiti Malaya has also started the Go For Gold (GFG) training programme as one of the steps to achieving a Malaysian gold medal in the IChO. As for now, invitations to the programme are sent directly to school administrators and not open to the public.

Within the training camp, several tests will be held and the top 4 scorers will be chosen to represent Malaysia in the IChO.
