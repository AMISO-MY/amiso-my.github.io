# Introduction

The International Physics Olympiad (IPhO) is an annual physics competition for high school students. It is one of the International Science Olympiads. The first IPhO was held in Warsaw, Poland in 1967.

Each national delegation is made up of at most five student competitors plus two leaders, selected on a national level. Observers may also accompany a national team. The students compete as individuals, and must sit for intensive theoretical and laboratory examinations. For their efforts the students can be awarded gold, silver, or bronze medals or an honourable mention.

# Format of the IPhO

The competition consists of two examinations which are the theoretical examination and the practical examination.

The theoretical examination lasts 5 hours and consists of three questions. Usually these questions involve more than one part.

The practical examination may consist of one or two laboratory examinations, which also lasts for a total of 5 hours.

# Eligibility

The contestants shall be students of general or technical secondary schools i.e. schools which cannot be considered technical colleges. Students who have finished their school examinations in the year of the competition can be members of the team as long as they have not commenced their university studies. The age of the contestants should not exceed twenty years on June 30th of the year of the competition.
