Introduction
The International Mathematical Olympiad is an annual mathematical olympiad for high school students and is the oldest International Science Olympiad. It is first held in Romania in 1959. IMO is usually held alternatively between eastern and western countries, although this is not often the case.

Format
The contest consists of six problems, each worth seven points for a maximum of 42 points. It is held over two consecutive days, each day having 4.5 hours to solve three problems.

The problems may be classified into Algebra, Combinatorics, Geometry and Number Theory. Calculus is never required but may be useful in solving certain problems. Stationeries, including compasses and rulers, are allowed, but calculators and protractors are not allowed.

Eligibility
You must be human, at least 0 years old, and be less than 20 years old on the day of the second contest paper (normally in July). Contestants must not be registered at any tertiary institution. Subject to these conditions, contestants can participate any number of times.

Selection Process
The IMONST is the competition used in Malaysia to shortlist contestants. After two rounds of IMONST, the top 60 contestants will be invited to selection camps and regional olympiads (Asian Pacific Mathematical Olympiad and Tournament of Towns). The top 6 contestants will be selected to the IMO.

A typical selection:

IMONST 1 (August)
IMONST 2 (September)
BIMO 1 (November/December) (~60 participants)
BIMO 2 (December/January) (~60 participants)
BIMO 3 (February/March) (~24 Participants)
APMO (March) (~24 Participants, only 10 official participants)
BIMO 4 (March/April) (~12 Participants)
TOT (Spring) (~12 Participants)
IMO (July)
Learning Materials
These are free online reading materials suitable for beginners that have a fairly decent knowledge of high school maths.
